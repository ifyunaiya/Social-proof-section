# Social-proof-section

##This is my solution to the front end mentor social proof section challenge.

I experimented with grid and flexbox, using position: relative to create the ladder effect for the cards. 
It was quite fun and simple.

Feel free to look at it here: https://ifyunaiya.github.io/Social-proof-section/
 i do believe its a work of beginners front end art web design (if such a thing exists).
